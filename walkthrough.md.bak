# Antigravity Mobile Notification System - Walkthrough

## Overview
We have built a flexible "Global Notification Bridge" that connects your Linux Laptop to your Phone.

**How it works:**
1.  **Laptop Bridge (`bridge.py`)**: Listens to the Linux system notification bus (DBus).
2.  **Ntfy.sh**: Acts as the relay server (no account needed).
3.  **Your Phone**: Receives notifications via the Ntfy app (recommended) or our custom Flutter Companion App.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `bridge/` -> Contains the Python script to run on your laptop.
- `app/` -> Contains the Flutter source code for the mobile companion app.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Start the Laptop Bridge
The bridge needs to be running to capture notifications.

```bash
cd /home/sam/Documents/antigrav_mobile/bridge
./run_bridge.sh
```
*Tip: You can add this script to your "Startup Applications" to have it run automatically on boot.*

### 2. Setup Your Phone
**Option A: The Easy Way (Native Ntfy App)**
1.  Install **Ntfy** from the Play Store (Android) or App Store (iOS).
2.  Subscribe to the topic: `antigrav_sam_notifications`
3.  Done! You will now receive alerts.

**Option B: The Custom App (For learning)**
1.  We have built a custom flutter app in `app/`.
2.  Run the app on your phone (via USB debugging) or Emulator:
    ```bash
    cd /home/sam/Documents/antigrav_mobile/app
    flutter run
    ```
3.  The app shows a dashboard and notification history.

### 🛠️ Building the APK (Manual)
If you want to build the APK file to transfer to your phone:
```bash
cd /home/sam/Documents/antigrav_mobile/app
flutter build apk --debug
```
The file will be at: `app/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`

## ✅ Verification & Debugging
1.  Ensure the bridge is running.
2.  Open a terminal on your laptop.
3.  **Run a test notification using `notify-send`**:
    This standard Linux command sends a desktop notification that our bridge listens for.
    ```bash
    # Syntax: notify-send "Title" "Body"
    notify-send "Antigravity" "This is a test from your laptop!"
    ```
4.  **Result**: Your phone should buzz immediately!

### Troubleshooting
If you don't receive it:
- Check the terminal where `./run_bridge.sh` is running. You should see logs like:
  ```
  [Received] App: notify-send, Title: Antigravity
  [Sent] Antigravity: This is a test...
  ```
- If you see `[Skipped] Duplicate`, it means the same message was sent too quickly. Try changing the text.

## 📚 Educational Notes
I have heavily commented the code in `bridge/bridge.py` and `app/lib/main.dart` to explain:
- **DBus Monitoring**: How we "spy" on system messages.
- **HTTP Requests**: How we talk to the Ntfy web API.
- **Flutter State**: How the app manages the list of messages.

Enjoy your connected experience!
